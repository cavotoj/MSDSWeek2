Even just sitting literally doing nothing and it'll BSOD.  \\n  \\n**Reproducing the error:**  \\n- I can't get it to do it, I'll go back to the same webpage and open the same video and it'll be fine.  Or I'll open what was just fine the other day but now makes it crash.  \\n- I don't even know how I would reproduce it, seeing as how I don't know what the cause is in the first place.  \\n  \\n**Notes:**  \\n- The stop code is VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE and the thing that failed was: amdkmdag.sys  \\n\\nPosting this again because I still haven't figured it out.

       " \"New Ryzen 5 3600 running SCARY HOT! Behaving very strangely...\\n\\nLet's start with what it's doing. Stock cooler, preapplied paste, aftermarket cooler arrives in 2 days. After a restart, I sit at around 70c. It will go down to about 54c before rocketing back up to 70c in a single refresh. The voltage also seems to jump around from 1.02 to 1.40 randomly, the higher the V the higher the T, of course. I am using the stock cooler for the next few days, and I'm 100% certain that that's not the problem. When I restart my computer, between the bios flash screen, and windows screen, the CPU cooler spools up like a jet engine. Other than that, it never seems to change speeds despite being set through the bios and Asus AI to be on a *steep* curve correlating to temperature. Right now I'm sitting here with Chrome open, and it's at 65. 64. 62. 58. 54. 69. 70. 65. 64. 58. 70. Load is 2-3%. I let the computer sit there alone for about 10 minutes and it will hang out around 55c, moving the mouse or doing anything brings it back up to 60-65c and opening a *tab in chrome* rockets it up to 70c again.\\n\\nOk, here's what I've done. Keep in mind, this is a fresh machine, fresh install on fresh drives. I have read the writeup from AMD\\\\_Robert (I think?) about voltages. I am not sure I really understand half of it, and I don't have anything monitoring the core except for Asus AI, Ryzen Master. Both the BIOS and Asus AI are set to an fan profile supposed to crank em up and I don't hear much of anything happening, even when I change it manually from Silent to FULL SPEED there is no perceivable difference, aside from the program reporting a difference of 1000rpm. Whatever this speed that happens in the interim between bios and windows, it is not achievable through any software. I'm using Ryzen Balanced power mode, because it gives me temps about 2c cooler if I let the system sit there completely truely idle for a long time. Again, this is maybe 55c at the lowest, and if I even look at the computer it jumps back up to 65c. I have the most recent AMD chipset drivers. My bios is up to date (2006). My other AMD Radeon drivers are also installed and up to date.\\n\\nI'm really hoping I don't have a screwed up chip or something. I'm going to submit this, and take the damned thing apart ...\\n\\nI've just noticed my GHZ are jumping up to 4200 for no discernable reason, while just sitting here typing. It's sitting at 3600 for a while, then 4200 for a while, back and forth. What the hell.

Does this mean that if i insert a 3200 module it\\'s always going to run at 2400? or that depends on the RAM stick itself? what do u recommend me to do?\\n\\nRight now i\\'m thinking on getting this one [https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/memory/impact-ddr4](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/memory/impact-ddr4)  \\nit will work since it has the auto OC function or is not going to work because of the processor limit?\\n\\nThanks in advance to take of your day to help me out.',\n",

What we really need is the RDNA2 equivalent of the Radeon 7, which is currently on Vega, which is a generation old. The RTX 3080 itself is almost double the Radeon 7 performance. What AMD has to do is effectively double the performance of the Radeon 7 by making a 350 watt card that can scale good enough and be at least 70% faster than the Radeon 7, aka 40% to 50% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti.

That being said, I do agree that the measures Intel is taking (and has taken) to make their competitors to look \"as bad as possible\" have been taken too far. Omitting the µarch specific optimizations for other than their own CPU designs is granted, but outright gimping the code when CPUID returns anything else but \"GenuineIntel\" brand-string is wrong and frankly, pretty pathetic. But I guess desperate times require desperate measures.\\n\\nIn any case... There is really no need to rely on Intel to give AMD CPUs a fair treatment, according to their true capabilities since the vendor dependent dispatcher can be disabled rather easily by modifying the binaries themselves. Sure, Intel can alter the way the dispatcher works however, at this point it\\'s pretty unlikely since it has remained virtually unchanged for a decade or so.\\n\\nSo basically when you have a binary that is either compiled with Intel C/C++/Fortran compilers with /Qax??? or /Qx??? options enabled, or a binary that features Intel MKL:\\n\\nOpen the binary with a HEX-editor and search for all instances of a hex string: 47656E75h (Genu) which is the first of the three parts of the Intel brand-string GenuineIntel. The other two parts of the Intel brand-string are 696E6549h (ineI) and 6E74656Ch (ntel). All of these strings are located close to one and other (< 32 bytes) and they are preceeded by a compare (CMP, e.g. 81h BCh) instruction that is resposible for the said dispatching.\\n\\nTo disable the dispatcher, primary opcode 81h will be changed to F7h opcode and the secondary opcode that varies (e.g. BCh, 7Ch), will be converted by nulling its bits 5:3 (SO &= C7h). So for instance if the binary has 81h primary and BCh secondary opcodes preceeding any of the partial brand-string instances, they\\'ll become F7h primary and 84h secondary (BCh & C7h = 84h). When this is done for all of the instances, all of the partial brand-string instances will be nulled (47656E75h >> 00000000h, 696E6549h >> 00000000h, 6E74656Ch >> 00000000h).\\n\\nNote that ALL binaries which are compiled using Intel compiler will include the described elements, regardless if the used compiling options were generic (/arch) or specifically Intel CPU targeted (Qax / Qx). On recent Intel compiler versions (released after 2011) and at least until now, using a generic (/arch) compile option WILL NOT generate discriminating code, unlike /Qax and /Qx options which do. There is a vast amount of known software which have been compiled using Intel compiler and therefore the binaries will contain the elements that are associated with the dispatcher. However, this does not mean that there is any kind of gimping going on. Feel free to try yourself. For example, at least the last three versions of Cinebench (R11.5, R15 and R20) have all been compiled using Intel compiler, and so is the most recent version of Adobe Photoshop CC for example.\\n\\nI personally don\\'t do any interpreted languages, which would be handy for tools like this however, I\\'m sure someone here can write a simple tool for the purpose using e.g. Python.\\n\\nHere\\'s unpatched (left) and patched (right) mt-dgemm / mt-sgemm (feat.

    "# Stretch goal (bonus-ish)\n",
    "### Although this is not formally a bonus for points, it is a learning opportinity.  You are not required to complete the following part of this notebook for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analysis technique above works, but has some shortcomings.  The biggest shortcoming is that each word is treated individually.  But what if we have a sentence with a negation?  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is not a bad thing.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence should be positive overall, but AFINN only has the word 'bad' in the dictionary, and so the sentence gets an overall negative score of -3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate sentiment analysis methods use neural networks to capture context as well as semantics.  The drawback of NNs is they are computationally expensive to train and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier method is to use a slightly-improved sentiment analysis technique, such as TextBlob or VADER (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) in Python.  Both libraries use a hand-coded algorithm with word scores like AFINN, but also with additions like negation rules (e.g. a word after 'not' has it's score reversed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sentiment analysis libraries in Python can be read about here: https://www.iflexion.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-python\n",
    "\n",
    "### The stretch goal\n",
    "The stretch goal is to use other sentiment analysis libraries on the Reddit data we collected, and compare the various approaches (AFINN word-by-word, TextBlob, and VADER) using plots and statistics.  For the AFINN word-by-word approach, you will need to either sum up the sentiment scores for each comment, or average them.  You might also divide them by 5 to get the values between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief example of getting scores from the 3 methods described above.  We can see while the raw AFINN approach gives a score of -0.6 (if normalized), TextBlob shows 0.35 and VADER shows 0.43."
